# Angular and ASP.NET Core JWT Authentication Project

This project is a template for building a web application using Angular for the front-end, Angular Material and Bootstrap for UI components, and an ASP.NET Core API for the back-end with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js and npm: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Angular CLI: Install globally using `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code for ASP.NET Core development
- .NET 5.0 SDK: [Download and Install .NET 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-angular-project.git
   cd your-angular-project
   ```

2. Front-end setup:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ng serve
   ```

   Your Angular app will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`.

3. Back-end setup:

   ```bash
   cd ../server
   dotnet restore
   dotnet run
   ```

   Your ASP.NET Core API will be available at `http://localhost:5000/`.

4. Configure JWT authentication:
   - Modify the authentication settings in `appsettings.json` to suit your needs.
   - Implement user registration, login, and token generation in your API controllers.

5. You may need to configure CORS settings in your ASP.NET Core API to allow requests from your Angular app.

## Folder Structure

- `client/`: Angular front-end application.
- `server/`: ASP.NET Core API back-end.

## Features

- Angular Material and Bootstrap for UI components.
- JWT authentication for secure API access.
- Sample code for user registration and login.

## Deployment

To deploy your application, follow the deployment guidelines for Angular and ASP.NET Core separately.
